- Video resolution settings are a must
- Cathedral Tutorial Elevator is a little bumpy on low FPS
- Had trouble getting started in CathedralTutorial (didn't know you could press screens)
- Keep the numbers that allow multiple solutions
- Too long, too difficult
- Cathedral: current value not immediately clear vs target value
- Black room: don't let the projector controls
