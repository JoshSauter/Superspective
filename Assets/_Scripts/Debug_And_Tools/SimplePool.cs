///   UPDATES:
/// 	2015-04-16: Changed Pool to use a Stack generic.
/// 
/// Usage:
/// 
///   There's no need to do any special setup of any kind.
/// 
///   Instead of calling Instantiate(), use this:
///       SimplePool.Spawn(somePrefab, somePosition, someRotation);
/// 
///   Instead of destroying an object, use this:
///       SimplePool.Despawn(myGameObject);
/// 
///   If desired, you can preload the pool with a number of instances:
///       SimplePool.Preload(somePrefab, 20);
/// 
/// Remember that Awake and Start will only ever be called on the first instantiation
/// and that member variables won't be reset automatically.  You should reset your
/// object yourself after calling Spawn().  (i.e. You'll have to do things like set
/// the object's HPs to max, reset animation states, etc...)
/// 
///
