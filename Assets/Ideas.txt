Mechanics:
 - Pillars and DimensionObjects
 - Non-pillar DimensionObjects
 - Portals
 - PickupCubes which can travel through Portals and around Pillars
 - Can stand on PickupCubes in other dimension
 - Teleporting picture frames
 - PickupSpheres that power nearby PowerTrail (have to make it travel along the PowerTrail path or something)
 
 - PickupCubes which, when dropped, set their gravity to "away from the player". Or, that the player can "plaster" into a target gravity direction through some ability.

 Story:
  - Analogue for predetermination and lack of free will, perhaps at the end giving the player a choice that leads to one of two endings

  Misc Notes:
  - Elevator: Subtle, rising shephard's tone when going up, falling shephard's tone when going down in the background
